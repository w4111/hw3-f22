# Homework 3

* Assigned: 10/13
* Due: 11/1 @ 11:59PM ET
* worth 3.75% of your grade

This assignment has two parts. In the first part, you will first flex your SQL muscles by writing SQL and reflecting on your experience. You will submit the completed colab notebook on Gradescope with submission instructions shown at the bottom of the notebook. In the second part, you will perform some normalizations that will be visible on Gradescope as an online assignment.

# 2. (14 pts) Normalization

### Warmup questions:

(2 points) **Q2.1**: You have a relation `R(A,B,C)` and functional dependencies 
  `A->C, B->C`

  * What are all the non-trivial functional dependencies in the closure
    that have  only one attribute on the right side?
  * What are all the keys of `R`?

(3 points) **Q2.2**: You have a relation `S(A, B, C, D)` and functional dependencies 
  `AB->D, AC->D, BD->A, and CD->B`

  * What are all the non-trivial functional dependencies in the closure
    that have  only one attribute on the right side?
  * What are all the keys of `S`?

### Real application. 

The Iowa dataset has the following un-normalized schema:


        CREATE TABLE iowa (
            address char(256),
            bottle_volume_ml integer,
            category char(256),
            category_name char(256),
            city char(256),
            county char(256),
            county_number char(256),
            date date,
            im_desc char(256),
            invoice_line_no char(256),
            itemno integer,
            name char(256),
            pack integer,
            sale_bottles integer,
            sale_dollars double precision,
            sale_gallons double precision,
            sale_liters double precision,
            state_bottle_cost double precision,
            state_bottle_retail double precision,
            store integer,
            store_location char(256),
            store_location_address char(256),
            store_location_city char(256),
            store_location_zip char(256),
            vendor_name char(256),
            vendor_no integer,
            zipcode text
        );

Suppose we have the functional dependencies:

        store -> address, name, city, zipcode, store_location, store_location_adress,
                county_number, county, store_location_zip, store_location_city
        vendor_no -> vendor_name
        category -> category_name, im_desc
        itemno -> category_name, bottle_volume_ml, im_desc, state_bottle_cost, state_bottle_retail
        date, store, vendor_no, itemno, invoice_line_no -> pack, sale_bottles, sale_dollars, sale_gallons, sale_liters


(2 points) **Q2.3**: What are the keys in 'iowa'?

(3 points) **Q2.4**: Decompose `iowa` into 3NF (Third Normal Form).  Write a few sentences to justify
  why you chose the tables you did.  

(2 points) **Q2.5**: Is your schema redundancy and anomaly free?  Justify your answer in
   a few sentences.

(2 points) **Q2.6**: We want to ensure that an order cannot purchase more than 10
   bottles (`bottle_qty`).  Can you enforce this using functional 
   dependencies?  Justify your answer

(1 point) **Q2.7**: Let's verify whether `store` indeed determines the store name.   How many distinct `name` values 
   exist for `store` number `2508` in the `iowa` dataset?  Solve this by running a SQL query.

(1 point) **Q2.8**: In class, we discussed that functional dependencies (and constraints in general) cannot be
  determined just by looking at data in the database.  
  Argue in one or two sentences whether or not `store -> name` is should actually be a functional dependency and why.
